# path-scurry

Extremely high performant utility for building tools that read
the file system, minimizing filesystem and path string munging
operations to the greatest degree possible.

## Ugh, yet another file traversal thing on npm?

Yes. None of the existing ones gave me exactly what I wanted.

## Well what is it you wanted?

While working on [glob](http://npm.im/glob), I found that I
needed a module to very efficiently manage the traversal over a
folder tree, such that:

1. No `readdir()` or `stat()` would ever be called on the same
   file or directory more than one time.
2. No `readdir()` calls would be made if we can be reasonably
   sure that the path is not a directory. (Ie, a previous
   `readdir()` or `stat()` covered the path, and
   `ent.isDirectory()` is false.)
3. `path.resolve()`, `dirname()`, `basename()`, and other
   string-parsing/munging operations are be minimized. This
   means it has to track "provisional" child nodes that may not
   exist (and if we find that they _don't_ exist, store that
   information as well, so we don't have to ever check again).
4. The API is not limited to use as a stream/iterator/etc. There
   are many cases where an API like node's `fs` is preferrable.
5. It's more important to prevent excess syscalls than to be up
   to date, but it should be smart enough to know what it
   _doesn't_ know, and go get it seamlessly when requested.
6. Do not blow up the JS heap allocation if operating on a
   directory with a huge number of entries.
7. Handle all the weird aspects of Windows paths, like UNC paths
   and drive letters and wro
